Marco has followed us from the very beginning, reviewed our prototypes, tried our samples, discussed our projects and shot the finished products in their natural environment  the mountains.  Marco is one of those passionate mountain people that seem to be born smiling, and being a passionate climber and photographer, you will either catch him with an ice tool or with the Nikon in hand.  Born in 74, he was brought up in the Aosta Valley and even if various trips in all corners of the world keep him busy enough , the Aosta valley is his home and favourite place on earth.  As a guide and founder of the Compagnie des Guides de Champoluc, he lets his clients discover the most beautiful spots of the Rosa Planet, or how about ski touring in total freedom through the untouched valleys of the Rosa planet or conquering a high mountain or reaching a peak or an uncontaminated valley  8230;          Catalogo   Zaini  Hardware  Imbragature  Accessori  Libri  Promozioni    Blue Ice   People  La nostra parte  Editing    Blog          Italiano English Fran ais          Navigation  Catalogo    8211; Zaini    8211; Hardware    8211; Imbragature    8211; Accessori    8211; Libri    8211; Promozioni  Blue Ice    8211; People    8211; La nostra parte    8211; Editing  Blog  Italiano English Fran ais                        We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.
