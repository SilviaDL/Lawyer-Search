His background and formation is erratic and multidisciplinary including art, theatre, cinema and film critics.  Son of a music hall actor and dancer and a classical and music hall dancer, in 1995  he studies acting in Paris with the Balinese Peter  Brook company actor Tapa Sudana.  In 1996 while studing History and Critics of  Cinema at the Rome University La Sapienza,  he creates, together with Carlo Hintermann and Luciano Barcaroli,  the Citrullo International Working Crew and begins to work on books interviews with filmmakers, as Otar Ioseliani and Takeshi Kitano, both published by the Italian publishing house Ubulibri.  Then in 2000, they establish together with Gerardo Panichi the film production company Citrullo International,  with which he produces and directs creative documentaries on art and cinema   among the others  Rosy fingered Dawn  a film on Terrence Malick  (2002) and  F For Fontcuberta  (2005)  , which are screened at the major national and international festival as Venice Film Festival, Rome Film Festival, Turin Film Festival,  FIFA Montreal, Stockolm Film Festival, Bangkock Film Festival, BFI London. In 2011 he produces  The Dark Side of the Sun , directed by Carlo Hintermann, premiered at the Rome Film Festival.  Terrence Malick  Rehearsing the Unexpected ,  curated together with Hintermann, has been published in 2015 by the British publishing company Faber and Faber.  He directs his visual research creating collage based works, made solely with paper, scissors and glue. Free from the perfecting powers of computer manipulation, the concept of his collages floats between the nostalgia for lost harmonies and a frantic search for new ones. Rather than being driven towards fragmentation and disorientation, his work leans more towards a paradoxical unity. His film making background leads to him pay meticulous attention to the images, their editing and their narrative.  His research is gradually moving towards assemblage, installations and performances investigating the concept of memory and divination.  With Serbian musician Aleksandar Caric Zar he creates in 2012  the live collage performance Synchronotopy that represents a meeting point between the two sides of his artistic research,  matching  the private dimension of  the collage creation process with the public experience of a movie screening.
