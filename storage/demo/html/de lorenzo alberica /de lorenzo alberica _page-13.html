Generally, a broker must have more specialized education as well as licensing, and as a result is legally authorized to execute a real estate transaction. Brokers usually play a more administrative role in the real estate process. An agent, by contrast, is a salesperson hired by a broker to interact with and handle the legwork for the clients.  A buyer s agent represents a home buyer or seller in a real estate transaction. A buyer s agent will find Alberica, IT property listings that match your needs, works with the seller s agent to schedule showings and accompanies you on visits to tour the home. If you re interested in the house, the agent handles price negotiations and other terms of the sale, and coordinates the appropriate paperwork.  A seller s agent will help you determine a listing price for an Alberica, IT property and can suggest repairs, upgrades and staging ideas to boost the home s appeal. He or she is in charge of marketing the house to prospective buyers and other agents through signage, websites, print ads, open houses and other methods. As with a buyer s agent, a seller s agent represents you in negotiating the sale.
