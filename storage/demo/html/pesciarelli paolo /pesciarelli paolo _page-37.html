To this end, we used a masked priming paradigm to investigate implicit processing of the eyes and mouth in upright and inverted faces, using a prime duration of 33 ms. Two types of prime target pairs were used  1. congruent (e.g., open eyes only in both prime and target or open mouth only in both prime and target); 2. incongruent (e.g., open mouth only in prime and open eyes only in target or open eyes only in prime and open mouth only in target). The identity of the faces changed between prime and target. Participants pressed a button when the target face had the eyes open and another button when the target face had the mouth open. The behavioral results showed faster RTs for the eyes in upright faces than the eyes in inverted faces, the mouth in upright and inverted faces. Moreover they also revealed a congruent priming effect for the mouth in upright faces. The ERP findings showed a face orientation effect across all ERP components studied (P1, N1, N170, P2, N2, P3) starting at about 80 ms, and a congru  ency priming effect on late components (P2, N2, P3), starting at about 150 ms. Crucially, the results showed that the orientation effect was driven by the eye region (N170, P2) and that the congruency effect started earlier (P2) for the eyes than for the mouth (N2). These findings mark the time course of the processing of internal facial features and provide further evidence that the eyes are automatically processed and that they are very salient facial features that strongly affect the amplitude, latency, and distribution of neural responses to faces.

In the present study, we used the ultimatum game paradigm to investigate how participants playing as proposers modulate their strategic economic behavior, according to their game counterparts  stereotypical identity (i.e., responders).  The latter were introduced to the participants using occupational role nouns stereotypically marked with gender paired with feminine or masculine proper names (e.g., linguist Anna; economist David; economist Cristina; linguist Leonardo).  When playing with male stereotyped responders, proposers quickly applied the equity rule, behaving fairly, while they adopted a strategic behavior with responders characterized by female stereotypes. They were also longer to make their offers to female than to male responders but both kinds of responders received comparable offers, suggesting a greater cognitive effort to treat females as equally as males.  The present study explicitly demonstrates that gender stereotypical information affect strategic economic decision making and highlights a possible evolution of that gender discrimination into a more insidious discrimination toward individuals with female characteristics.

Idiom strings were embedded in highly predictable, literal and idiomatic contexts. EEG data showed that the integration of the idiom s conventional meaning occurred at the end of the expression and affected the Post N400 Positivity. Time Frequency Representation of the EEG clarified that prior to integrating the idiom s meaning, an increase in power of higher gamma frequency band was associated only with literal processing. We argue that idioms comprehension proceeds in discrete steps  idiom recognition hampers semantic composition processes so that readers wait until the end of the expression to integrate the idiom meaning with the representation of the sentence.

The mechanisms that underlie on line processing of stereotypical information in other age groups have received much less attention. This is the first study to simultaneously investigate real time processing of gender stereotypes at different age levels. We investigated the activation of gender stereotypes in Italian in four groups of participants  third  and fifth  graders, young and older adults. Participants heard a role noun associated with masculine stereotypical (preside  headmaster ) or feminine stereotypical (badante  social care worker ) gender followed by a male (padre  father ) or female kinship term (madre  mother ). The task was to decide if the two words   the role noun and kinship term   could describe the same person. Across all age groups, participants were significantly faster to respond, and were more likely to press  yes , when the target was preceded by a stereotypically congruent than incongruent prime. These findings suggest that information about the stereotypical gender associated with a role noun is incorporated into the mental representation of this word and is activated as soon as the word is heard.

Antonymy is the most robust of the lexico semantic relations and is relevant to both the mental organization of the lexicon and the organization of coherent discourse, as attested by the resurgence of interest in antonymy in the linguistic and psychological domains. In contrast, the vast literature on semantic processing in schizophrenia almost ignored antonymy. In this study, we tested the online comprehension of antonyms in 39 Italian patients with paranoid schizophrenia and in an equal number of pairwise matched healthy controls. Participants read a definitional sentence fragment (e.g., the opposite of black is), followed by the correct antonym (white) or by a semantically unrelated word (nice), and judged whether or not the target word was correct. Patients were rather accurate in identifying antonyms, but compared to controls, they showed longer response times and higher priming scores, suggesting an exaggerated contextual facilitation. Presumably, this reflects a deficient controlled semantic processing and an overreliance on stored semantic representations    Cacciari, Cristina; Pescarelli, Francesca; Gamberoni, Tania; Ferlazzo, Fabio ( 2015 )   Is black always the opposite of white  The comprehension of antonyms in schizophrenia and in healthy participants.

Notwithstanding this wealth of evidence, the exact role and the time course of the processing of this distributional information remain unclear. This ERP study investigated if and when the brain detects gender to ending consistency in sentences containing Italian determiner noun pairs. Determiners either agreed or disagreed in gender with nouns whose endings were reliable or misleading cues to gender (Transparent and Irregular nouns, respectively). Transparent nouns elicited an increased frontal negativity and a late posterior positivity compared to Irregular nouns (350 950ms), suggesting that the system is sensitive to gender to ending consistency from relatively early stages of processing. But gender agreement violations evoked a similar LAN P600 pattern for both types of nouns. These findings provide evidence for an early detection of reliable gender related endings during sentence reading.

The proposers  identity was manipulated using occupational role nouns stereotypically marked with gender(e.g., Teacher; Engineer),paired with either feminine or masculine proper names(e.g., Anna; David). Greater FRN amplitudes reflected the early processing of the conflict between the strategic rule (i.e., earning as much money as possible) and ready to go responses (i.e., refusing unequal offers and discriminating proposers according to their stereotype) .Responders were found to rely on a dual process system(i.e., automatic and heuristic based system1 vs. cognitively costly and deliberative system2), the P300 amplitude reflecting the switch from a decision making system to another .Greater P300 amplitudes were found in response to both fair and unfair offers and male stereotyped proposers  offers  reflecting an automatic decision making based on heuristics, while lower P300 amplitudes were found in response to3  offers and the female stereotyped proposers  offers reflecting a more deliberative reasoning. Overall, the results indicate that participants were more motivated to engage in a costly deliberative reasoning associated with an increase in acceptation rate when playing with female stereotyped proposers who may have induced more positive and emphatic feelings in the participants than did male stereotyped proposers. Then, we assume that people with an occupation stereotypically marked with female gender and engaged in an economic negotiation may benefit from their occupation at least in the case their counterparts lose their money if the negotiation fails.

Preference for literal rather than figurative interpretations continues to be documented. The main aim of this study was to establish whether patients are indeed able to use combinatorial semantic processing to comprehend literal sentences and both combinatorial analysis, and retrieval of pre stored meanings to comprehend idiomatic sentences. The study employed a sentence continuation task in which subjects were asked to decide whether a target word was a sensible continuation of a previous sentence fragment to investigate idiomatic and literal sentence comprehension in patients with paranoid schizophrenia. Patients and healthy controls were faster in accepting sensible continuations than in rejecting non sensible ones in both literal and idiomatic sentences. Patients were as accurate as controls in comprehending literal and idiomatic sentences, but they were overall slower than controls in all conditions. Once the contribution of cognitive covariates was partialled out, the response times (RTs) to sensible idiomatic continuations of patients did not significantly differ from those of controls. This suggests that the state of residual schizophrenia did not contribute to slower processing of sensible idioms above and beyond the cognitive deficits that are typically associated with schizophrenia.

Typically, CCPs are formed by a first preposition (P1) followed by a content word (N1) and a second, final preposition (P2) (in the   P1   hands   N1   of   P2). Despite their default structure stored in semantic memory, some CCPs allow internal modification (e.g., adjective insertion). In this study, two experiments tested the comprehension of CCPs in which we modified their default structure inserting an adjective before the noun. This modification preserved the semantic well formedness of the string. The self paced reading time study (Experiment 1) showed that readers took significantly longer to read the CCP constituents after the inserted adjective (N1 and P2). The ERP (Experiment 2) showed a smaller N400 response to the noun when preceded by the adjective, suggesting that the insertion did not disrupt the online processing of the CCP. Critically, the adjective insertion increased the processing load of the prepositional phrase introduced by the CCP, as evidenced by a LAN in response to the complement noun (N2). Overall, these findings showed that processing CCPs was not disrupted by insertions despite their predefined default word order. Rather, their interpretation was semantically enriched, correlating with an increase in the processing load when the CCP was integrated with the complement noun.

However, it is still unclear when the linguistic processor identifies word ending cues to gender, and whether this information affects syntactic agreement processing. This ERP study investigated the time course of gender agreement processing with Italian nouns whose word ending was a reliable or a misleading cue to gender (transparent, irregular nouns). The nouns were preceded by gender agreeing or disagreeing determiners and were embedded in sentences. The ERPs on target nouns showed main effects of Transparency and Gender Agreement. Specifically, transparent nouns elicited an increased frontal negativity (350 750 ms) and a posterior positivity (750 950 ms) compared to irregular nouns. This suggests that the system is sensitive to gender to ending consistency from early stages of processing and that this information remains available until later processing stages. In addition, gender agreement violations evoked a LAN (350 500 ms) followed by a P600 (550 950 ms). The lack of interaction between Agreement and Transparency suggests that agreement processing is relatively unaffected by gender to ending consistency.

Consistently, a number of MEG and ERP studies have shown syntactic effects as early as 150 ms after stimulus onset (Dykker et al., 2009; Pulvermuller et al., 2007). The aim of the present study was to establish how early grammatical gender became available to the reader. Given its important role in syntactic structure building (especially in Romance languages), we hypothesized that grammatical gender information should become available between 100 and 300 ms, as predicted by syntax first models. To this aim, we conducted an ERP study adopting a paradigm designed to monitor an early ERP component, the N2pc. This attentional component was chosen because of its early sensitivity to linguistic variables (Dell Acqua et al., 2007). 600 Italian noun adjective pairs whose gender agreed or disagreed were selected. The noun was presented centrally and was followed by two lateralized stimuli (the adjective and a distractor) presented for 200 ms. Participants judged noun adjective gender agreement. ERP results showed that agreement violations influenced the amplitude of the N2pc between 170 and 310 ms. Specifically, a greater negativity was observed at P7 for the agreement condition relative to the disagreement condition. These results suggest that grammatical gender information is available at an early stage of language comprehension (100 300 ms).

The literature did not yet provide a univocal answer on whether the comprehension of non literal, abstract motion sentences engages the same neural networks recruited for literal sentences. A previous TMS study using the same experimental materials of the present study showed activation for literal, fictive and metaphoric motion sentences but not for idiomatic ones. To evaluate whether this may depend on insufficient time for elaborating the idiomatic meaning, we conducted a behavioral experiment that used a sensibility judgment task performed by pressing a button either with a hand finger or with a foot. Motor activation is known to be sensitive to the action congruency of the effector used for responding. Therefore, all other things being equal, significant differences between response emitted with an action congruent or incongruent effector (foot vs. hand) may be attributed to motor activation. Foot related action verbs were embedded in sentences conveying literal motion, fictive motion, metaphoric motion or idiomatic motion. Mental sentences were employed as a control condition. foot responses were significantly faster than finger responses but only in literal motion sentences. We hypothesize that motor activation may arise in early phases of comprehension processes (i.e., upon reading the verb) for then decaying as a function of the strength of the semantic motion component of the verb.

Previous studies showed that the N2pc, an attention related ERP component, can be modulated by lexical semantic variables. However, it remains to be seen whether the N2pc can be affected by grammatical features as well. To test this, we conducted an N2pc study with Italian word pairs whose grammatical gender either agreed or disagreed. Participants read a centrally presented noun followed by an adjective in a lateralized position during a gender agreement task. Between 170 and 310ms, the N2pc was elicited contralaterally to the adjective position with a left lateralized effect of the agreement manipulation. These results suggest that this component could be influenced by grammatical features, supporting a functional interaction between processes mediating visual spatial attention and agreement computation.

The mechanisms that underlie on line processing of stereotypical information in other age groups have received little or no attention. This is the first study to investigate on line processing of gender stereotypes from a life span perspective. In fact, we investigated the activation of gender stereotypes in four groups of participants, third and fifth graders, young and cognitively preserved older adults. Participants heard a role noun associated with masculine stereotypical or feminine stereotypical gender followed by a male or female kinship term. Their task was to decide if these two words could describe the same person. Across all age groups, participants were significantly faster to respond, and were more likely to press YES, when the target was preceded by a stereotypically congruent than incongruent prime. These findings suggest that information about the stereotypical gender associated with a role noun is incorporated into the mental representation of this word and activated as soon as the word is heard.

To this end, we used a masked priming paradigm to investigate implicit processing of the eyes and mouth in upright and inverted faces, using a prime duration of 33 ms. Two types of prime target pairs were used  1. congruent (e.g., open eyes only in both prime and target); 2. incongruent (e.g., open mouth only in prime and open eyes only in target). The identity of the faces changed between prime and target. Participants pressed a button when the target face had the eyes open and another button when the target face had the mouth open. The behavioral results indicated a congruent priming effect for the mouth in upright faces and for the eyes in inverted faces. In addition, the ERP results indicated a face orientation effect across all ERP components studied (P1, N1, N170, P2, N2, P3) starting at about 80 ms, and a congruency priming effect on late components (P2, N2, P3), starting at about 150 ms. Interestingly, the results showed that the orientation effect was driven by the eye region and that the congruency effect started earlier (P2) for the eyes than for the mouth (N2). These congruency effects were followed by a P3 component, which peaked later for the incongruent than congruent conditions. These findings provide further evidence that the eyes are automatically processed and that are very salient facial features that strongly affect the amplitude, latency, and distribution of neural responses to faces.

Preference for literal rather than figurative interpretations continues to be documented. The main aim of this study was to establish whether patients are indeed able to use combinatorial semantic processing to comprehend literal sentences and both combinatorial analysis and retrieval of pre stored meanings to comprehend idiomatic sentences. The study employed a sentence continuation task in which subjects were asked to decide whether a target word was a sensible continuation of a previous sentence fragment to investigate idiomatic and literal sentence comprehension in patients with paranoid schizophrenia.  Patients and healthy controls were faster in accepting sensible continuations than in rejecting non sensible ones in both literal and idiomatic sentences. Patients were as accurate as controls in comprehending literal and idiomatic sentences, but they were overall slower than controls in all conditions. Once the contribution of cognitive covariates was partialled out, the response times to sensible idiomatic continuations of patients did not significantly differ from those of controls. This suggests that the state of residual schizophrenia did not contribute to slower processing of sensible idioms above and beyond the cognitive deficits that are typically associated with schizophrenia.

Using event related brain potentials (ERPs), we examined the brain response to third person pronouns (lei  she  and lui  he ) that were implicitly primed by definitional (passeggeraFEM  passenger , pensionatoMASC  pensioner ) or stereotypical antecedents (insegnante  teacher , conducente  driver ). An N400 like effect on the pronoun emerged when it was preceded by a definitionally incongruent prime (passeggeraFEM   lui; pensionatoMASC   lei), and a stereotypically incongruent prime for masculine pronouns only (insegnante   lui). In addition, a P300 like effect was found when the pronoun was preceded by definitionally incongruent primes. However, this effect was observed for female, but not male participants. Overall, these results provide further evidence for online effects of stereotypical gender in language comprehension. Importantly, our results also suggest a gender stereotype asymmetry in that male and female stereotypes affected the processing of pronouns differently.

Both get their share only if the responder accepts the offer. Despite what would be predicted by expected utility  models, typically some offers (most frequently the lowest ones) are rejected, being considered unfair  3 . Brain imaging and  TMS studies  2, 4 5, 7  have investigated the brain circuits involved in different aspects of the UG. In the present study, we  tested the hypothesis that the identity of the proposers, specifically, their economic status, i) affects acceptance rates; ii)  modulates brain activity of the responders in the UG protocol.  Methods   Twenty one healthy right handed volunteers (all females; mean age 22.8   177; 3.1) took part in this study. During the fMRI  scan, each volunteer was asked to play 54 trials (split in 3 runs) of UG. All human proposers were presented as females  and could be either A) old age retirees living on a small pension, or B) well to do businesswomen professionals. Their  identity was introduced by a brief description including first name, age and social status (e.g., Maria, 84, with minimum  pension). Offers by a computer were the control condition. The amount of money to share was   10 in each trial, with three  types of offers. that we defined as  Unfair (1 or 2  ), Fair (4 or 5  ), Mid value (3  ). On each trial, participants saw the  description of the proposer (8 s), then they were presented with an offer (8 s). Both proposer and offer type were presented  in random order. Finally, participants accepted or rejected the offer by pressing a button. Functional imaging was performed  on a 3T Philips Achieva scanner. Thirty axial slices were acquired (TR 2000 ms; FOV 240x240 mm; in plane  matrix 80x80; voxel size 3.0x3.0x4.0 mm). Data analysis was carried out using a General Linear Model (GLM) as  implemented in SPM5; significance level was set at    lt; 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons, as assessed by AlphaSim  (http   afni.nimh.nih.gov afni doc manual AlphaSim).  Results   Behavioral data  Acceptance rates were significantly higher for proposer A than for the other proposers, for both Unfair and  Mid value offers (p lt;0.001), but not for Fair offers.  fMRI data  Unfair offers, compared to Fair offers, elicited signal increases in anterior mid cingulate cortex (aMCC) and right  prefrontal cortex (PFC); smaller (subthreshold) clusters were present also in left PFC and, bilaterally, in anterior insula  (Fig.1). The contrast Fair vs. Unfair offers did not elicit suprathreshold activity.  When we compared proposer B vs A in the trials in which offers were subsequently accepted, we found a significant signal  increase in the right insula (Fig. 2). When offers were subsequently rejected, a comparison of proposer A vs B revealed an  active cluster in precuneus posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (Fig. 3). The opposite contrasts did not reveal any significant  cluster.  Conclusions   We show here that the economic status of the proposers selectively affects i) acceptance rates, and ii) brain activity;  namely, in case of accepted offers, proposer B caused a selective activation in posterior insula. This area is known to have  complex functions, among which a role in pain perception and modulation  6  and in attention to negative emotions  8 . This  activation might suggest that accepting the offers from proposer B bears some similarity with an unpleasant experience. In  case of subsequently rejected offers, proposer A caused a selective activation in precuneus PCC. This is a very complex  region, part of the so called  quot;default mode network quot;, which is active during the conscious resting state, and inhibited during  non self related tasks  1 . We may hypothesize that rejecting offers from a proposer with whom people could easily  empathise, implies a greater focus on first person perspective, an    Anna Siyanova Chanturia; Francesca Pesciarelli;  amp; Cristina Cacciari ( 2011 )   Activating gender stereotypes in Italian during online language processing.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the activation of gender stereotypes in Italian. Participants were primed with a noun or an adjective that belonged to one of the following categories  (1) masculine stereotypical gender unmarked (conducente  driver ); (2) feminine stereotypical gender unmarked (insegnante  teacher ); (3) masculine biological without stereotypical gender bias (pensionato  pensioner ); (4) feminine biological without stereotypical gender bias (passeggera  passenger ); (5) stereotypically neutral gender unmarked (conoscente  acquaintance ). The prime was immediately followed by a target, which was a personal pronoun lui ( he ) or lei ( she ). Participants were required to decide as quickly as possible whether the pronoun was masculine or feminine.      The results showed faster RTs in congruent conditions, both biological (pensionato   lui, passeggera   lei) and, crucially, stereotypical (conducente   lui, insegnante   lei), compared to incongruent ones (pensionato   lei, passeggera   lui; and conducente   lei, insegnante   lui). Although the effect was stronger for biological gender manipulations than stereotypical ones, our results provide further support for a stereotypical gender priming effect in language.

To comprehend these over learned expressions the combination of single words meanings might not be readers  most effective strategy. In the present study we used ambiguous idioms (e.g., land on someone s feet) that have both a conventional meaning and a semantically well formed literal interpretation, to isolate and compare the cognitive operations at play during compositional and non compositional processing of the same sequences of words.   The strings were inserted in different contexts  an Idiomatic Context Condition (IC) (1); a Literal Context Condition (LC) (2); a Control Condition (CC) where the last word of the idiom string was embedded in a literal sentence (3). The predictability of the last word of the idiom strings was equally very high across conditions.  In Experiment 1, we recorded Event Related Potentials (ERPs). We assumed that processing idiomatic configurations of words  3  involves recognition  4  and whole meaning integration processes. Therefore we expected that the recognition of the idiomatic strings should be facilitated in IC compared to LC and this could be reflected in a larger P300 effect. The integration of the idiomatic meaning in the sentential context might be reflected in N400 effects,  5 ) or, alternatively, in P600 effects  6  if additional inferences based on vocabulary information are needed to preserve sentence coherence. The ERP waveforms showed an early positive effect (P300 like) on the penultimate word of the expression in IC. The processing of the last constituent was also influenced by the previous context  a late positive effect was observed on the last idiomatic constituent in IC compared to CC.   To test whether the literal meaning of the idioms was computed even in idiomatic contexts  3  we ran a cross modal lexical decision times experiment (Experiment 2) in which the visual target was either related or unrelated to the literal meaning of the last constituent of the idiom string. The results showed that regardless of context the literal meaning of the last constituent of the expression was still available at the offset of the idiom string. This suggests that the meanings of the constituent words are activated even when the idiom has been recognized as a conventional expression. Overall, our results show that idiom comprehension processes differ from literal processing  idioms need to be first recognized as such and recognition is easier when idioms are inserted in idiomatic contexts. At the end of the expression the conventional meaning is integrated into the sentence and because of the local ambiguity of the string readers might need to draw additional inferences to preserve sentence coherence, retrieving and integrating the conventional meaning of the expression.

It has been demonstrated that there is an association between number magnitude and response preference with faster left hand responses for small numbers and faster right hand responses for large numbers (SNARC effect for Spatial Numerical Association of Response Codes), suggesting the existence of a  Mental Number Line .  Involuntary shifts of attention to the left or right visual field have been shown to occur when stimuli with a strong meaning (e.g. numbers, direction arrows, etc) abruptly appear in the visual field, even when the observers know that these stimuli are irrelevant to the task and must be ignored. Since numbers convey not only magnitude but also order, the question of whether non numerical ordinal information is also spatially coded follows. Although initially the SNARC effect was found exclusively with numbers as stimuli further studies showed that non numerical information such as letters of the alphabet, months of the year, days of the week, etc. is also spatially coded. Based on these findings in the present study we investigated whether perceiving letters of the alphabet can induce such a shift of attention to the left or right visual field. 23 subjects did a detection task in which they had to fixate a central white cross on a black screen, followed by either one of the two letters A or Z (the first and the last letters of the Italian alphabet) or a neutral cue (a diamond) presented for one of the durations (500 ms, 800 ms or 1000 ms) randomly. After the letter disappeared, the target, a small white square, appeared on the left or the right of the fixation point. In 20  of the trials a white circle appeared instead of the square, as catch trials. Participants were to press the space bar as soon as they detected the target (a white square). The results showed that there were significant shifts of attention after perceiving Z but not A, and these shifts were generated only for the trials where the letter was presented the longest (1000ms). This suggests that the spatial component of letters might not be as strong as those of the numbers, and it probably takes longer for letter perception to induce shifts of attention.

Neurobiology of Language   pp.              da       11                  a 11                  Poster (275)   Poster   Abstract  There is evidence showing that stereotypical gender associated with certain occupations and characteristics is incorporated into speakers  representations, and that such information is difficult to suppress during on line language processing (Cacciari  amp; Padovani, 2007; Oakhill, Garnham,  amp; Reynolds, 2005). However, relatively little is known about the neural correlates involved in, and the time course of, the processing of such information. Existing studies have shown that different neural processes may engage in the processing of gender stereotypes (Irmen, Holt,  amp; Weisbrod, 2010; Osterhout, Bersick,  amp; McLaughlin, 1997; White, et al., 2009).    The aim of the present ERP study was to investigate the activation of gender stereotypes in Italian using a paradigm adapted from Banaji and Hardin (1996). Specifically, our goal was to establish how early such information becomes available to the reader. Participants were presented with a prime, such as  (1) masculine stereotypical gender nouns (conducente  driver ); (2) feminine stereotypical gender nouns (insegnante  teacher ); (3) masculine biological gender nouns without associated stereotypes (pensionato  pensioner ); (4) feminine biological gender nouns without associated stereotypes (passeggera  passenger ); or (5) bi genders without associated stereotypes (conoscente  acquaintance ). Each prime was followed by either a masculine or a feminine personal pronoun (Lui  he  vs. Lei  she ). Participants decided whether the pronoun was masculine or feminine, while their RTs and ERPs were recorded.    Participants were faster to judge the gender of the pronoun (as masculine or feminine) when it was preceded by a gender congruent prime, compared to a gender incongruent one. This was found in biological and stereotypical conditions.    The ERP results suggest two different effects. First, a larger negativity between 200 and 380 ms peaking around 300 ms (most prominent across frontal central sites) was observed when masculine and feminine pronouns were preceded by biological gender incongruent vs. biological gender congruent primes. When primes had a stereotypical connotation, this negativity was found only for masculine pronouns preceded by stereotypical gender incongruent primes compared to stereotypical gender congruent ones. Second, an increased positivity between 380 and 500 ms peaking around 420 ms (most prominent across frontal central sites) was observed when pronouns followed biological, but not stereotypical, gender incongruent primes.    Our results for biological gender violations appear to be comparable to those reported by Barber and Carreiras (2003), who observed negativity around 400 ms for gender incongruent conditions in word pairs. Our seemingly early and more frontal effect could be due to the use of function words (pronouns) rather than content ones used by Barber and Carreiras (2003). The positivity around 420 ms for biological gender violations appears to be in line with the P300 effect, observed in Barber and Carreiras (2003) together with N400 which preceded it. Crucially, our findings provide further support for online effects of stereotypical gender in language comprehension. The presence of a large negativity for the masculine but not feminine pronoun suggests that when the gender stereotype conveyed by the prime was feminine, the brain registered a mismatch in response to a stereotype violating pronoun (insegnante  teacher    lui  he ). In sum, male and female gender stereotypes affected the processing of pronouns differently.    Anna Siyanova Chanturia; Francesca Pesciarelli;  amp; Cristina Cacciari ( 2011 )   ERP evidence for the activation of gender stereotypes  The case of Italian.   The 17th Annual Conference on Architectures and Mechanisms for Language Processing   pp.              da       23                  a 23                  Poster (275)   Poster   Abstract  Language users have mental representations of words (e.g., occupation nouns and personal characteristics) that include information about the word s stereotypical gender. This information is difficult to suppress during on line language processing (e.g., Banaji  amp; Hardin, 1996; Cacciari  amp; Padovani, 2007; Oakhill, Garnham,  amp; Reynolds, 2005). The few electrophysiological studies conducted on this topic showed that different neural processes are engaged in the processing of gender stereotype information (Irmen, Holt,  amp; Weisbrod, 2010  N400, P600; Osterhout, Bersick,  amp; McLaughlin, 1997  P600; White, et al., 2009  N400).    In this ERP study we investigated the activation of gender stereotypes in Italian using a priming paradigm adapted from Banaji and Hardin (1996). Our aim was, first, to establish how early this information becomes available to the reader, and, second, to uncover the ERP signature of the emergence of gender stereotypes in language. Participants were presented with a prime that could be  a masculine or feminine stereotypical gender noun (conducenteMASC  driver  vs. insegnanteFEM  teacher ); a masculine or feminine grammatically marked noun (pensionatoMASC  pensioner  vs. passeggeraFEM  passenger ). Each prime was followed by either a masculine or a feminine personal pronoun (Lui  he  vs. Lei  she ). Participants decided whether the pronoun was masculine or feminine, while their RTs and ERPs were recorded. Primes and targets were controlled for psycholinguistic variables (length, frequency); in addition, masculine and feminine stereotypes were matched in stereotype strength and valence.    As in previous behavioural studies, participants were faster to judge the gender of the pronoun when preceded by a gender congruent than gender incongruent prime in both biological and stereotypical conditions. The ERP results suggest two different effects. First, when the pronouns were preceded by biological grammatically marked incongruent nouns (e.g., pensionato lei; passeggera lui), a larger negativity between 200 and 380 ms peaking around 300 ms (most prominent across frontal central sites) emerged. Interestingly, when the pronouns were preceded by stereotypical primes, a negativity with similar latency and distribution emerged in the incongruent condition only for masculine pronouns. Second, an increased positivity between 380 and 500 ms peaking around 420 ms (most prominent across frontal central sites) was observed when pronouns followed biological, but not stereotypical, gender incongruent primes.    The waveforms we obtained for biological gender violations are comparable to the N400 reported by Barber and Carreiras (2003). Our seemingly early and more frontal effect could be due to the use of function words (pronouns) rather than content ones as in Barber and Carreiras (2003). The positivity around 420 ms for biological gender violations appears to be in line with the P300 effect observed in Barber and Carreiras (2003) together with the N400. Crucially, our ERP results provide further support for online effects of stereotypical gender in language comprehension. When a role noun is read, the stereotypical gender associated with it, if any, is activated together with other lexical semantic information and might prime gender congruent nodes. Remarkably, the ERP confirmed a gender stereotype asymmetry (cfr. Cacciari  amp; Padovani, 2007), in that male and female gender stereotypes affected the processing of pronouns differently.      The results imply that participants seemed more accepting of female drivers than male teachers, suggesting that gender stereotypes (conveyed by occupation nouns or personal characteristics) might be less restrictive for females than males. According to social psychologists, one social group (e.g., males) can become more normative than another (e.g., females) (Hegarty  amp; Pratto, 2001). Indeed, attitudes and stereotypes have been found to be influenced    Caffarra, S.; Pesciarelli, F.;  amp; Cacciari, C.

Numerosi autori (Bates et al., 1996) hanno sottolineato come la trasparenza ortografica fonologica del suffisso possa facilitare l elaborazione di genere grammaticale, rendendola pi  249; rapida o pi  249; accurata rispetto a parole fonologicamente opache (dove il suffisso non   232; informativo) o irregolari (dove il suffisso   232; un cattivo predittore del genere). Un altra variabile rivelatasi utile per i processi d accordo   232; il genere biologico  nelle parole riferite ad esseri umani il sesso biologico del referente rafforza l informazione di genere grammaticale, velocizzandone l elaborazione (Vigliocco et al., 1999). Al fine di indagare i fattori che influenzano l elaborazione del genere grammaticale   232; stato condotto uno studio comportamentale sull Italiano, lingua particolarmente indicata data la sua elevata regolarit  224;.   Metodo  sono state presentate 336 coppie di parole (nome aggettivo), manipolando due variabili  l accordo grammaticale e la tipologia di nome (trasparente, opaco, irregolare con genere biologico o arbitrario). 24 soggetti (16 donne) avrebbero dovuto giudicare il grado di accordo tra nome e aggettivo.   Risultati  I nomi trasparenti biologici fanno registrare le risposte pi  249; accurate e rapide in assoluto. Di seguito, troviamo le parole trasparenti e biologiche opache, con risposte pi  249; lente rispetto ai nomi biologici trasparenti, ma pi  249; rapide rispetto alle parole opache. Infine, i nomi irregolari mostrano i tempi di risposta e l accuratezza pi  249; elevati rispetto alle altre tipologie di parole.  Conclusioni  I risultati comportamentali mostrano che  1. la trasparenza ortografica fonologica del suffisso, pure essendo un informazione ridondante, influenza l elaborazione di genere grammaticale; 2. Anche la presenza di un informazione concettuale come quella del genere biologico ha un effetto sull analisi dell accordo.    Nakhai, S.; Pesciarelli, F.; Mapelli, D.;  amp; Cacciari, C.

Questo studio si propone di indagare l attivazione del genere stereotipico attraverso il paradigma di Banaji e Hardin (1996). I partecipanti leggevano nomi cui poteva essere associato  1. un genere stereotipico maschile (conducente); 2. un genere stereotipico femminile (insegnante), o che possedevano 3. un genere biologico maschile (pensionato); 4. un genere biologico femminile (passeggera); o 5. nomi bi generi senza stereotipi (conoscente). Il prime era seguito dai pronomi  Lui  o  Lei . Il compito era decidere se il pronome fosse maschile o femminile.  I partecipanti erano pi  249; veloci nel decidere il genere del pronome se preceduto da prime congruenti sia per prime con genere biologico che stereotipico. I risultati ERP mostrano  1. una negativit  224; intorno a 300 ms quando i pronomi erano preceduti da prime con genere biologico incongruente. Quando i prime erano caratterizzati da genere stereotipico, la negativit  224; era presente solo per i pronomi maschili preceduti da prime incongruenti, cio  232; con stereotipo femminile; 2. una positivit  224; intorno a 440 ms quando i pronomi non concordavano col genere biologico marcato nel prime. I risultati ERP per le violazioni di genere biologico sono comparabili a quanto osservato in precedenza da Barber e Carreiras (2003) e Hagoort e Brown (1999). I risultati mostrano un effetto asimmetrico del genere stereotipico (Cacciari  amp; Padovani, 2007)  la mancata corrispondenza fra direzione dello stereotipo associato al prime e pronome   232; percepita come mismatch dal cervello solo quando il genere stereotipico associato al prime e  femminile (insegnante Lui) ma non maschile (conducente Lei).

T1 T2 lag was about 300 ms so that T2 was often missed (blinked) whereas T1 and T3 were almost correctly reported. In a ERP study under such conditions, Pesciarelli, et al. (2007) observed a semantic modulation of the T3 locked P2 component that was independent on the correct report of T2 and a semantic effect on the T3 locked N400 that was detected only when T2 was not blinked. The present study is aimed at exploring how these semantic effects are modulated by the context. The experimental items were mixed with filler items containing T2 T3 related pairs in one condition, and T2 T3 unrelated pairs in the other condition. The results showed that both the P2 and the N400 semantic effects were modulated by the context and independent (i.e. either one effect, or the other, or both, or none, were observed)  The N400 effect for T2 reported trials was wider in the related filler than in the unrelated filler context whereas the P2 effect was present only in the unrelated filler context and independent on the correct report of T2.

We used nouns in which the final vowel is consistent with the typical gender to ending distribution in Italian (transparent nouns ending in  aFEM and in  oMASC; e.g. bibitaFEM,  drink  ); nouns in which the final vowel is not informative of the gender (opaque nouns, ending in  e; e.g. verniceFEM,  paint ); and nouns whose grammatical gender does not conform to the gender that would be expected from the suffix (irregular nouns; e.g. manoFEM,  hand ). Previous research suggests that when the orthographical phonological information conveyed by the noun suffix is inconsistent with gender, lexical processing is slower and less accurate (Bates, Devescovi, Pizzamiglio, D Amico  amp; Hernandez, 1995). However, the morphological status of the noun suffix and the time course with which the suffix is used in processing semantic gender and arbitrary grammatical gender are still unclear. To test the influence of the noun suffix on the gender processing, we used a paradigm highly similar to that employed by Dell Acqua, Pesciarelli, Jolicouer, Eimer  amp; Peressotti (2007). In our behavioural study we contrasted the role of the noun suffix in Italian nouns characterized either by a semantic gender (e.g., mammaFEM,  mother ) or by an arbitrary gender (e.g., lampadaFEM,  lamp ), with transparent, opaque or irregular endings. The noun was followed by two lateralized stimuli (an adjective and a distractor) presented one to the left and one to the right of a central fixation cross. Each noun was paired with a gender agreeing or disagreeing adjective (e.g bibitaFEM gasataFEM  gasatoMASC,  drink fizzy ) and participants were asked to judge whether they agree or not. Our results showed that  1. the gender to ending consistency of the suffix affected the computation of grammatical agreement; 2. the effect was stronger for biological than for arbitrary gender nouns. Our data confirm the direction of the effect of orthographical phonological transparency, further showing the influence of biological gender.    Caffarra, S.; Pesciarelli, F.;  amp; Cacciari, C.

More specifically, we utilized a masked priming paradigm to investigate implicit processing of the eyes and mouth in upright and inverted faces, using a prime duration of 33 ms. Two types of prime target pairs were used  (1) congruent (e.g., open eyes only in both prime and target); (2) incongruent (e.g., open eyes only in prime and open mouth only in target). The identity of the faces changed between prime and target. Participants pressed one button to indicate whether the target face s mouth was open, and another if the eyes were open. The behavioral results indicated a congruent priming effect for upright but not for inverted faces. The ERP results indicated a face orientation effect across all ERP components studied (P1, N1, P2, N170, N2, P3) starting at about 80 ms, and a congruency priming effect on late components (N2, P3), starting at about 200 ms. The functional significance of these ERP effects is discussed in relation to unconscious perception and configural face processing.    LEO, I; SARLO, M; F.

More specifically, we utilized a masked priming paradigm to investigate implicit processing of the eyes and mouth in upright and inverted faces, using prime duration of 50 ms. Three types of prime target pairs were used  1. congruent (e.g., open eyes only in both prime and target); 2. incongruent (e.g., open eyes only in prime and open mouth only in target) and 3. dual (both mouth and eyes open in the prime only followed by either type of target, i.e., either eyes or mouth but not both, open). The identity of the faces changed between prime and target. Participants pressed one button to indicate whether the target face s mouth was open, and an other if the eyes were open. The behavioural results indicated a congruent priming effect for both upright and inverted faces. In addition, we found an enhanced negativity at about 200 ms after target presentation. The amplitude of the N200 like depended on the relation between prime and target, being smaller when the stimuli were congruent in both upright and inverted faces. This N200 like was followed by a P300 component, which was influenced by the three conditions, with incongruency and dual producing a smaller positivity than congruency in both upright and inverted faces. Moreover, when the stimuli were presented upside down, the N200 and the P300 effects took place about 30 ms later. The functional significance of these ERP effects is discussed in relation to unconscious perception and configural face processing.    F.

Whereas T1 was not related to either T2 or T3, T2 and T3 could be unrelated words, semantically related words, or identical words. The results indicated semantic and repetition priming effects on T3 in both behavioral and electrophysiological estimates of performance. Semantic and repetition priming effects were independent on the report accuracy of T2, that is, the word most often missed because of a T1 locked attentional blink effect. The results suggest that semantic and repetition priming effects, under rapid serial visual presentation conditions, are modulated by overlapping mechanisms.    DELLACQUA, R; F.

Participants had to attend to a target string defined by color while ignoring the other distractor string. The target string could be a word or a nonword and the task was a delayed lexical decision. The distractor was always a word. When the target was a word, target and distractor were associatively related on half of the trials and not related in the other trials. The event related potential time locked to the onset of the letter strings produced an N2pc (a greater negativity at scalp sites contralateral to the target relative to the ipsilateral sites). The N2pc amplitude was reduced when the words were related relative to when they were not related. The results provide direct, online evidence that activation of meaning by visual words is very rapid, and interacts with the mechanisms responsible for the deployment of spatial attention.    F.

In addition, they can be instrumental in sheding light on each other, as several study in memory and description of places have shown (e.g. Linde  amp; Labov, 1975; Ullmer Ehrich, 1982; Mainardi Peron, Baroni, Job,  amp; Salmaso, 1990). Numerous analysis and empirical studies have shown that in the comprehension of spatial prepo  sitions factors related to the functions and contex  tually de ned roles of the elements, as well as to the linguistic meaning (Bennett, 1975), affect par  ticipants  performance (e.g. Garrod and Sanford, 1989; Coventry, Carmichael,  amp; Garrod, 1994; Cars  lon Radvansky and Radvansky, 1996). In the present study, we investigated the com  prehension of spatial preposition using a sentence  picture veri cation task with the aim of elucidating the role of real world knowledge in the processing of sentences. On the assumption that the compre  hension of expressions indicating spatial relations among elements relies crucially on contextual infor  mation we manipulated the type of pictorial informa  tion participants were presented with factors. On half of the trials, we provided an environment that could act as a frame for the interpretation of the spatial relation referred to by the verbal expression. On the remaining trial, the geometrical information remai  ned the same but no environmental information was provided. The predictions were the following  If environ  mental information is processed as fast as, or fas  ter than, geometrical information, a facilitation effect may be detected for the conditions in which a frame is provided. However, when environmental informa  tion and geometrical information mismatch, then providing a frame should hinder processing.    F.

It has become traditional to conceptualize the N400 as a temporal landmark of the stage at which semantics modulate the processing of verbal stimuli, and to interpret the relationship between semantic processing and N400 as biunivocal. One experiment is presented that suggests that such an interpretation must be reconsidered. Two horizontally arrayed strings of characters were visually presented in different colors (red and green) on each trial, one to the left and one to the right of a central fixation cross. Participants were instructed to perform a lexical decision on a target string defined by color (e.g., red), while ignoring the other distractor string (green). On half of the trials, both strings were words, and the semantic relation between the word concepts was systematically manipulated. An enhanced negativity at about 200 ms after target presentation was recorded at posterior electrodes contralateral to the visual hemifield occupied by the target word (i.e., N2pc). Crucially for our purposes, the amplitude of the N2pc depended on the semantic relation between the word concepts, being smaller when the word concepts were semantically related. The conclusions relate the present evidence of early semantic activation with past conceptualizations about semantic processing.    POTTER, M.

The two words were semantically related or unrelated and were sepa  rated by stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 0 213msec. Accuracy in reporting the first target (T1) versus the second target (T2) has been shown to interact dramatically with SOA over this range. The materials were in English in Experiment1 and Italian in Experiment2. T1 was semantically primed only at short SOAs, whereas T2 was primed at all SOAs (Experiment1) or at all SOAs except the shortest one (Experiment2). The results indicate a strong competition between target words early in process  ing, with T2 often becoming the first word identified at short SOAs, thus priming T1.

In Experiment 2, T1 was an auditory stimulus, and T2 a visual stimulus embedded in an RSVP stream. Participants made a speeded discriminative response to T1, and reported T2 at the end of the stream. An attentional blink (AB) effect was observed in both experiments  T2 report suffered at short SOA compared to long SOA. During the AB, the amplitude of the P300 component of the event related potential (ERP) locked to T2 onset was sensibly reduced in both experiments. Behavioral and ERP results were very similar across the two experiments. Implications for models of the AB effect are discussed.    F. PESCIARELLI; DELL  39;ACQUA, R.; PALOMBA, D.; JOB, R.

Two visual targets were presented at variable Stimulus Onset Asynchronies (SOAs) embedded in a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) of black distractors.  The first stimulus, T1, was a white digit varying from 1 to 9.  The second stimulus was a black letter, that could be either an   39;E  39; (T2) on 25  of the trials, or a different letter on the remaining trials.  Subjects were instructed to report, with no speed pressure at the end of each RSVP of characters, both the identity of the T1 digit and whether or not T2 was presented following T1.  Beyond classical estimates of the accuracy in reporting T1 and T2, the Evoked Response Potential (ERP) locked to the onset of T2 was measured in the present experiment.  The behavioral results indicated an Attentional Blink (AB) effect, i.e., T2 report accuracy decreased as the T1 T2 SOA was shortened.  The electrophysiological results indicated a sensitive correlation between T2 accuracy and P3 component amplitude of the ERP, i.e., the P3 amplitude decreased monotonically as the T1 T2 SOA was shortened.
